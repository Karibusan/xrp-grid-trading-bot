# Commit with the provided message
git commit -m "Add individual trade tracking and margin calculation" -m "This commit adds comprehensive trade tracking and margin calculation functionality to the XRP Grid Trading Bot. The enhancements address feedback about tracking individual trades and calculating margins per trade.

Key changes:

- Add TradeDatabase class for persistent trade storage
- Implement unique ID tracking for each trade
- Add complete trade lifecycle tracking (pending → open → filled)
- Implement sophisticated margin calculation algorithm
- Add detailed performance reporting and statistics
- Create trade report generation functionality
- Add documentation for trade tracking features

The bot now tracks each trade individually with a unique ID and records all relevant information including price, volume, status, and execution details. The margin calculation algorithm matches sell orders with corresponding buy orders to calculate precise margins.

These enhancements provide complete transparency into trading activity and profitability, allowing users to track the exact profit/loss of each trade and make data-driven decisions to optimize their strategy."
