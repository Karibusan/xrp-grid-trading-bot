## 📦 Good practices

- Keep dependencies minimal
- Stick to the modular structure (`src/`)
- Use `.env.example` as reference for new variables
- Keep new modules optional (fallbacks, toggles)
- Avoid vendor lock-in when possible (support local LLMs, self-hosted setups)

---

## 🙌 You can also...

- Improve documentation (`README.md`, `/docs`)
- Share feedback or ideas via issues
- Submit real-world use cases (anonymized logs, results)
- Help improve the community-trained LLM (coming in v5.0)
