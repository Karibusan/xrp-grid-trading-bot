# Advanced Configuration Guide

This document provides detailed information about the advanced configuration options available in the XRP Trading Bot v2.0.0.

## Dynamic Sizing

Dynamic sizing adjusts the order volume based on the distance from the current price. This feature helps optimize capital allocation by placing larger orders at price levels that are more likely to be profitable.

### Configuration

In the main `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "dynamic_sizing": true
}
```

### Behavior

When enabled:
- Buy orders below current price: Volume increases as price decreases
- Sell orders above current price: Volume increases as price increases

This creates a non-linear distribution of capital across the grid, concentrating more resources at price extremes where profit potential is higher.

## Stop Loss Percentage

The stop loss feature provides protection against significant market downturns by automatically closing positions when losses reach a specified threshold.

### Configuration

In the main `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "stop_loss_percentage": 12.0
}
```

### Behavior

- The system monitors the overall portfolio value
- If the value drops by more than the specified percentage from its peak, the system:
  1. Cancels all open buy orders
  2. Places market sell orders for current holdings
  3. Enters a temporary trading pause
  4. Resumes trading once market conditions stabilize

## Profit Reinvestment

Profit reinvestment automatically allocates trading profits back into the grid strategy, allowing for compound growth over time.

### Configuration

In the main `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "profit_reinvestment": true
}
```

### Behavior

When enabled:
- The system tracks profits from completed trades
- A portion of profits is automatically added to the total allocation
- Grid levels are recalculated with the new allocation
- New orders are placed with increased volumes

## Advanced Module Configuration

### Signal Collapse Detector

The Signal Collapse Detector monitors correlation between technical indicators to identify potential market risks.

Key configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "correlation_threshold": 0.85,
  "lookback_periods": 14,
  "risk_reduction_percentage": 30
}
```

- `correlation_threshold`: Correlation level that triggers a signal collapse alert
- `lookback_periods`: Number of periods to analyze for correlation
- `risk_reduction_percentage`: Percentage to reduce position sizes when signal collapse is detected

### Capital Migration Manager

The Capital Migration Manager optimizes capital allocation across multiple trading pairs.

Key configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "trading_pairs": ["XRPGBP", "XRPEUR", "XRPUSD"],
  "opportunity_threshold_percentage": 1.5,
  "min_allocation_percentage": 10.0,
  "max_allocation_percentage": 80.0
}
```

- `trading_pairs`: List of pairs to monitor and trade
- `opportunity_threshold_percentage`: Minimum opportunity difference to trigger migration
- `min_allocation_percentage`: Minimum allocation for any trading pair
- `max_allocation_percentage`: Maximum allocation for any trading pair

### Strategic Bifurcation Manager

The Strategic Bifurcation Manager switches between different trading strategies based on market conditions.

Key configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "volatility_threshold": 5.0,
  "trend_threshold": 3.0,
  "range_threshold": 2.0,
  "strategies": ["trend_following", "mean_reversion", "range_trading", "volatility_breakout"]
}
```

- `volatility_threshold`: Volatility level that indicates a volatile market
- `trend_threshold`: Price change percentage that indicates a trending market
- `range_threshold`: Price range percentage that indicates a ranging market
- `strategies`: List of available strategies to use

### Technological Convergence Engine

The Technological Convergence Engine integrates multiple data sources for improved decision making.

Key configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "technical_analysis_weight": 0.5,
  "sentiment_analysis_weight": 0.2,
  "ml_prediction_weight": 0.3,
  "prediction_horizon_hours": 24
}
```

- `technical_analysis_weight`: Weight given to technical analysis signals
- `sentiment_analysis_weight`: Weight given to sentiment analysis
- `ml_prediction_weight`: Weight given to machine learning predictions
- `prediction_horizon_hours`: Time horizon for price predictions

### Survivability Manager

The Survivability Manager ensures system resilience during adverse conditions.

Key configuration parameters:

```json
{
  "health_check_interval_minutes": 15,
  "backup_interval_hours": 24,
  "emergency_shutdown_threshold": 0.15,
  "fallback_apis": ["kraken", "binance", "coinbase"]
}
```

- `health_check_interval_minutes`: Interval between system health checks
- `backup_interval_hours`: Interval between automatic backups
- `emergency_shutdown_threshold`: Portfolio loss percentage that triggers emergency mode
- `fallback_apis`: List of alternative APIs to use if primary API fails

## Performance Tuning

For optimal performance, consider the following adjustments:

### Low-Resource Systems (e.g., NAS devices)

```json
{
  "price_check_interval_minutes": 15,
  "modules": {
    "technological_convergence": {
      "enabled": false
    },
    "signal_collapse": {
      "check_interval_hours": 12
    },
    "strategic_bifurcation": {
      "check_interval_hours": 12
    }
  }
}
```

### High-Performance Systems

```json
{
  "price_check_interval_minutes": 1,
  "grid_levels": 24,
  "modules": {
    "technological_convergence": {
      "check_interval_hours": 1
    },
    "signal_collapse": {
      "check_interval_hours": 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Examples

### Conservative Configuration

```json
{
  "grid_range_percentage": 2.0,
  "grid_levels": 10,
  "total_allocation": 50.0,
  "stop_loss_percentage": 8.0,
  "profit_reinvestment": false
}
```

### Aggressive Configuration
