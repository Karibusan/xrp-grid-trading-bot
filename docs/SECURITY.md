## 🔐 Design philosophy

This bot is designed with:

- Minimal external dependencies
- Optional cloud integrations (never required)
- Full local compatibility (NAS, containers)
- Transparent logging

Security is not just a layer — it’s part of the architecture.

Thank you for helping us protect this project.
