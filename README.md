Grid Trading Strategy
This bot implements a grid trading strategy optimized for income generation:
Creates a non-linear price grid around the current XRP price
Places buy orders below current price and sell orders above
Uses dynamic order sizing for more efficient capital allocation
Adapts grid parameters based on market trends
Monitors and maintains the grid, recreating it when necessary
The strategy is specifically designed to work with existing XRP holdings without requiring additional funds.
